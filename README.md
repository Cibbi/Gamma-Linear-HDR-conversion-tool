# Gamma-Linear-HDR-conversion-tool
A tool for converting HDR material properties from gamma to linear or from linear to gamma.

This tool is made to make easier to port the colors from 2017 unity materials to 2018+ unity materials, due to the change on HDR values being considered linear instead of gamma space in the later versions.

Just right click the material(s) you want to convert and select "HDR Colors to linear" if you're upgrading materials from 2017 to 2018, or "HDR Colors to gamma" if you're downgrading from 2018 to 2017.

You may not need to use this tool if some shaders already have this change applied internally.
